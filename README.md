# Representation

This is a data visualization project attempting to visualize the demographics
of who has held seats in congress, the executive branch, as well as the supreme
court in comparison to what equal representation would truly look like.

It's in very early stages but would love help refactoring the components and
curating / collecting data.

Pull requests are welcome.

Have only recently started to put this together - here is a screengrab from
what it currently looks like
